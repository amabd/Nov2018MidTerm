Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
JDK contains JRE along with development tools such as compiler,debugger etc.JDK is a super set of JRE.
  JRE - JRE is the environment where JVM runs.It contains JVM,class libraries, and other files.
  Compiler - Converts source code(.java) into byte code(.class).
  Debugger - The Java Debugger,jdb, is a simple command-line debugger for java class.
What is IDE?
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment and enables users to write and debug programs.Examples:Eclipse,IntelliJ.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Eclipse,IntelliJ IDEA,NetBeans,Codeenvy,DrJava,BlueJ,JGrasp etc.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
User writes source code in an editor using IDE and the java compiler (javac) converts it to a class file called bytecode(.class). The bytecode gets executed by the JVM.
what is class?
A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.It describes the behavior/state of the object.

What is object?
Object is a bundle of data and its behavior. A car has states - color,model,vin number and behavior can be
forward and  reverse biased and break.

What is the entry point of an application?
The entry point is a class having a method with signature public static void main(String[] args).

Why main is static?
We do not need to create object for static methods to run.They can run itself.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Object class in the java.lang package.   BASE CLASS IS  java.lang.object

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Path variable is used to set the path for all java software tools such as javac.exe.
Class path is used to set the path for java classes.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Interface can have only abstract methods.Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
Interface has only static and final variables where as abstract class can have final, non-final,static and non-static variables. Interface can not provide the implementation of abstract class.
All the members of interface are public by default.Members of an abstract class can be public,  private,  protected  or default.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
No.Interface will be implemented by other class.To use Abstract class we need to create another class
that will extend abstract class and the object of the child class will call both abstract
(abstract in parent,implemented in child class) and non-abstract methods.

what is Access Specifier?
Access Specifier helps to restrict the scope of a class, constructor , variable , method or data member.
There are four types of access specifier in java:
Default – Scope is package level.No keyword required
Private - Object accessible only in class in which they are declared.
Protected - Scope is within the class and subclass.
Public - Accessible to all.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming.
Object Oriented Programming features:
Abstraction-hiding unnecessary details of an object from the user.
Encapsulation-means binding object state(fields) and behaviour(methods) together.
Inheritance-process by which one class acquires the properties and functionalities of another class
Polymorphism-feature that allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A package is a group of classes, interfaces and other packages. It is used to provide access control
and to locate the related classes.Two types:Built-in packages and the User defined package.
java.lang is imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
API stands for Application Programming Interface.It includes all Java packages,classes and interfaces along with their method,fields and constructors.
List of API: java.io,  java.lang,  java.util.Random,   java.util.Scanner,  java.io.Filereader etc.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
No,Java does not allow multiple inheritance to avoid the ambiguity caused by it.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
In method overloading we can have multiple methods with the same name and same or different return type.
All these  method must have different parameters for the same return type.It is a part of java polymorphism
OOP principals.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program (at run time)
and it disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply java static keyword with variables,
methods, blocks and nested class. The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.
When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and
without reference to any object.
What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
final keyword is used in different contexts. First of all,final is a non-access modifier applicable only to
a variable, a method or a class.Following are different contexts where final is used. When a variable is
declared with final keyword, its value can't be modified, essentially, a constant. final (Java) ...
Once a final variable has been assigned, it always contains the same value. If a final variable holds
a reference to an object, then the state of the object may be changed by operations on the object,
but the variable will always refer to the same object (this property of final is called non-transitivity).
final modifier means that you cannot change variable, i.e. reference to your object, i.e. assign other
value to the same variable. ... final variable/reference means, you can't reassign another value to
that reference, but, you can change the state of the object.

What is final, finally and finalize?
Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.
Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.Finalize
is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected. 2) Final is a keyword.
final: final is a keyword. The variable declared as final should be initialized only once and cannot be changed.
Java classes declared as final cannot be extended. Methods declared as final cannot be overridden. ... finalize:
finalize is a method.

What is a constructor ?
Constructor is a block of code that initializes the object. A constructor resembles method in java but it is
not a method as it does not have a return type.Constructor has same name as the class.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
Yes,a class can have multiple constructors, as long as their signature (the parameters they take) are
not the same.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
Default constructor.
What is "this" keyword in java ?
The keyword "this" is a reference variable in Java that refers to the current object.
It can be used to refer instance variable of current class and to invoke or initiate current class constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
Super is a keyword used in java to refer the super class or base class.It is used inside a sub-class method
definition  to call a method defined in the superclass. Private methods of the super-class cannot be called.
Only public and  protected methods can be called by the super keyword. It is also used by class constructors
to invoke constructors of   its parent class.

What is JVM stand for ?
JVM stands for Java virtual machine. It enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written
in other  languages and compiled to Java bytecode.

Is JVM platform independent?
No, JVMs are not platform independent.

What version of java are you using?
java version "1.8.0_151"

What is JAR stand for ?
JAR stands for "Java ARchive".

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications
and applets.
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode
can be executed.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java
bytecode can be executed
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is what we need to run a Java program and contains a JVM, among other things.

What is compile time and run time?
The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become and executable program.
This compilation process is referred to as compile time. A compiled program can be opened and run by a user.
The terms "runtime" and "compile time" are often used by programmers to refer to different types of errors.

What is heap?
The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.

How java manage it's memory?
Java Memory Management is done with built-in garbage collection. It allows developers to create new objects
without   worrying explicitly about memory allocation and deallocation, because the garbage collector
automatically reclaims   memory for reuse.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable, if you try to alter their values, another object gets created,
whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable so they can change their values.
Thread-Safety Difference: The difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that
StringBuffer is thread-safe.

What is Singleton class?
In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object
(an instance of the class) at a time. ... To design a singleton class: Make constructor as private.
Write a static method that has return type object of this singleton class.
1.	We can make constructor as private. ...
2.	This property is useful to create singleton class in java.
3.	Singleton pattern helps us to keep only one instance of a class at any time.
4.	The purpose of singleton is to control object creation by keeping private constructor.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be
persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of
creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization.java.io.serializable.
We're putting all the bytes of our object together in order to store them and be able to reconvert
them as an object later. This is serializing.Serialization is the process of converting an object
into a stream so that it can be saved in any physical file like (XML) or can be saved in Database.
Serialization typically means writing the data as a string (think: xml / json) or as raw binary
(a byte[] etc). Deserialization is the reverse process; taking the raw data (from a file, from an
incoming network socket, etc) and reconstructing the object model. ... That can mean converting it
to a byte stream.


when to use transient variable in java?
When a variable is marked as transient, its object won't be serialized during serialization.
A transient variable is a variable that may not be serialized. We use the transient keyword to
indicate to the Java virtual machine that the indicated variable is not part of the persistent
state of the object.
Transient is a Java keyword which marks a member variable not to be serialized when it is
persisted to streams of bytes. When an object is transferred through the network, the object
needs to be 'serialized'. Serialization converts the object state to serial bytes.


Difference between while and do..while loop?
Only difference between these two loops is that, in while loops, test expression is checked at first
but, in do...while loop code is executed at first then the condition is checked. So, the code
are executed at least once in do...while loops.
While loop executes the code block only if the condition is True. In Java Do While loop,
condition is tested at the end of the loop so Do While executes the statements in the code
block at least once even if the condition Fails.

What is Enum?
A Java Enum is a special Java type used to define collections of constants. More precisely,
a Java enum type is a special kind of Java class. An enum can contain constants, methods etc.
When you need a predefined list of values which do not represent some kind of numeric or
textual data, you should use an enum. We should always use enums when a variable
(especially a method parameter) can only take one out of a small set of possible values

What is Iterator?
An iterator over a collection. Iterator takes the place of Enumeration in the Java Collections
Framework. Iterators differ from enumerations in two ways:  Iterators allow the caller to remove
elements from the underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined semantics.
1) Iterator is used for traversing List and Set both. We can use ListIterator to traverse
List only, we cannot traverse Set using ListIterator.
2) We can traverse in only forward   direction using Iterator. Using List  Iterator, we can traverse
a List in both the directions   (forward and Backward).

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Integer is an wrapper class/Object and int is primitive type. This difference plays
huge role when you want to store int values in a collection, because they accept
only objects as values (until jdk1.4). JDK5 onwards because of autoboxing it is
whole different story. int is a primitive type that represent an integer.
In general, the heap memory used by a Java object in Hotspot consists of:

#an object header, consisting of a few bytes of "housekeeping" information;
#memory for primitive fields, according to their size (int n->32 bits)
#memory for reference fields (4 bytes each) (Integer n ->32 bits)
#padding: potentially a few "wasted" unused bytes after the object data, to make
every object start at an address that is a convenient multiple of bytes
and reduce the number of bits required to represent a pointer to an object.
For int: 4 bytes used per element without wrappers, and 16 per element with a wrapper.

A wrapped double reports as 24 bytes per element, with the actual double value as 64 bits (8 bytes).


Why is String Immutable in Java?
The string is Immutable in Java because String objects are cached in String pool.Another reason
of why String class is immutable could die due to HashMap. Since Strings are very popular
as HashMap key, it's important for them to be immutable so that they can retrieve the value
object which was stored in HashMap.
String is widely used as parameter for many java classes, e.g. network connection, opening files,etc.
Where String not immutable, a connection or file would be changed and lead to serious security threat.
Mutable strings could cause security problem in Reflection too, as the parameters are strings.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
When A constructor calls another constructor of same class then this is called constructor chaining.
Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect
to current object. Constructor chaining can be done in two ways: Within same class: It can be done
using this() keyword for constructors in same class. Within a constructor, you can use the this keyword
to invoke another constructor in the same class. Doing so is called an explicit constructor invocation.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
both the serial and parallel collectors cause a stop-the-world during the GC. a serial collector
is a default copying collector which uses only one GC thread for the GC operation, while a
parallel collector uses multiple GC threads for the GC operation.

What is JIT stands for?
The JIT compiler is enabled by default, and is activated when a Java method is called.
The JIT compiler compiles the bytecodes of that method into native machine code, compiling
it "just in time" to run. When a method has been compiled, the JVM calls the compiled code
of that method directly instead of interpreting it.
The simplest tool used to increase the performance of your application is the Just-In-Time
(JIT) compiler. A JIT is a code generator that converts Java bytecode into native machine code.
Java programs invoked with a JIT generally run much faster than when the bytecode is
executed by the interpreter.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Java objects reside in an area called the heap. ... During the garbage collectionobjects
that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects. Note that the JVM
uses more memory than just the heap.
All objects are allocated on the heap area managed by the JVM. ... As long as an object is
being referenced, the JVM considers it alive. Once an object is no longer referenced and
therefore is not reachable by the application code, the garbage collector removes it and
reclaims the unused memory.
The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is
allocated. The heap is created on virtual machine start-up. Heap storage for objects is
reclaimed by an automatic storage management system (known as a garbage collector); objects
are never explicitly deallocated.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
System.gc() and Runtime.gc() are hooks to request the JVM to initiate the garbage collection process.
It can choose to reject the request and so it is notguaranteed that these calls will do the garbage collection.
This decision is taken by the JVM based on the eden space availability in heap memory.
Garbage collection does not guarantee that a program will not run out of memory. It is possible
for programs to use up memory resources faster than they are garbage collected. It is also possible f
or programs to create objects that are not subject togarbage collection.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store local variables
and function call while heap memory is used to store objects in Java. Variables stored in stacks
are only visible to the owner Thread while objects created in the heap are visible to all thread.
Variables allocated on the stack are stored directly to the memory and access to this memory is
very fast, and it's allocation is dealt with when the program is compiled. The basic difference
between stack and heap is that stack is used static memory location whereas heap is used for
dynamic memory allocation.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
Java Reflection is the process of analyzing and modifying all the capabilities of a class at runtime.
Java Reflection provides ability to inspect and modify the runtime behavior of application.
Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods,
classes, interfaces at runtime.Reflection gives us information about the class to which an
object belongs and also the methods of that class which can be executed by using the object.

what is multithreading in java?
Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously. A thread is a
lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading,
both are used to achieve multitasking.
Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a
program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is called a thread. we use
multithreading than multiprocessing because threads share a common memory area.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronized keyword in Java is used to provide mutually exclusive access to a shared resource
with multiple threads in Java. Synchronization in Java guarantees that no two threads can execute
a synchronized method which requires the same lock simultaneously or concurrently.
So there is a need to synchronize the action of multiple threads and make sure that only one
thread can access the resource at a given point in time. This is implemented using a concept
called monitors. Each object in Java is associated with a monitor, which a thread can lock or unlock.


What is Framework?
A framework provides functionalities/solution to the particular problem area.A software framework,
in computer programming, is an abstraction in which common code providing generic functionality
can be selectively overridden or specialized by user code providing specific functionality.
The java collection framework (JCF) is asset of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable
collection data structures. Collection framework allow us to manipulate and store group of object.
Collection Interfaces and classes are present in java.util package.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
Data Driven Framework, Keyword Driven Framework, Hybrid Framework, POM Framework.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
TestNG as core unit test framework for Java project, because TestNG is more advance in
parameterize testing, dependency testing and suite testing (Grouping concept). TestNG is
meant for high-level testing and complex integration test.TestNG is a testing framework
inspired by JUnit and NUnit. JUnit provides an easier and readable approach to test known as
Parameterized test. Both TestNG andJUnit supports parameterized test but differ in the way they
define the parameter value. Let see this one by one. The "@RunWith" and "@Parameter" annotations
are used to provide parameter value for the unit test. JUnit is shipped with most of the IDEs such
as Eclipse and NetBeans. There are many testing frameworks being developed using JUnit.
TestNG is an open source framework. It supports 1. parametrization, 2. data driven testing, 3. parallel execution.


What are the dependencies for this project?

what is dependency injection in java?

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Actual object is used for binding. It is also called early binding because binding happens
during compilation. It is also called late binding because binding happens at run time.
